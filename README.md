![Top View](/topview.png) </br>


This is a simple RC model of the SR-71 Blackbird made from foamboard. It's a flat-plate design made for park flying and testing.

## Overview

- **Material**: 5mm foamboard  
- **Aircraft type**: Delta wing, pusher jet  
- **Style**: SR-71 Blackbird  
- **Control surfaces**: Elevons (combined elevator + aileron)  
- **Motor position**: Rear center pusher  
- **Build level**: Beginner 
## Parts Needed

- **Motor**: 1307 or smaller brushless motor would work
- **ESC**: 12A to 20A  
- **Battery**: 2S LiPo (600–1000mAh)  
- **Servos**: 2× 4g servos  
- **Receiver**: Any 4+ channel RC receiver  
- **Propeller**: 5 to 6 inch  
- **Misc**: Hot glue, carbon rods , foamboard  

## Design Features

- SR-71 shape with delta wings  
- Central spar slot for strength  
- Twin vertical stabilizers  
- Lightweight and hand-launchable  
- Basic cutout for electronics bay  

## Build Instructions

1. Print or trace the plan onto foamboard  
2. Cut out the airframe parts  
3. Glue in the spar reinforcement  
4. Mount the servos and cut out control surfaces  
5. Install motor and ESC  
6. Connect and center control horns  
7. Attach vertical fins  
8. Check CG (around 25–30% from wing leading edge)  
9. Balance and test throws  
10. Go fly  

## Flight Tips

- Launch at slight upward angle with 60–70% throttle  
- Use expo for smoother controls  
- Avoid windy weather  
- Glide in slowly when landing  
- Don’t overpower the motor  

## Notes

- Keep it light for best performance  
- Use tape or reinforcement on high-stress areas  
- You can scale the model up or down depending on your battery and motor setup
